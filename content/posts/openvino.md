#### Pre-trained Models

You can use https://modelzoo.co/ for downloading pre-trained models already converted using the Model Optimizer.

#### Types of Computer Vision Models

In topic 3 models: Classification, Detection, and Segmentation.

Classification: given class of objects
Detection: determining objects (usually in bounding box)
Segmentation: classifying each and every pixel.
	
	semantic vs instance segmentation:

	* semantic all instance considered like one.
	* instance - separates instances of a class as separate objects.
